# Face-Recognition-Python
Face Recognition using Deep Learning. This is the code base for the paper Face Recognition using Deep Learning published in the Springer Book Series- Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering (LNEE)- ISSN- 1876-1100.
In this project, Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database was used. The aim of the project is to train a model to be able to detect/identify a single person from a database of people. For this purpose, A simple Artificial Neural Network and a Convolution Neural Netowrk were compared.
